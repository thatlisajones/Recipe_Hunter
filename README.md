# Recipe Hunter

This app uses AJAX to call the Food2Fork recipe API. Users input a main ingredient. The app returns three recipes featuring the ingredient.

Originally, I worked on this app as part of a boot camp team project. The GitHub repo for that project can be found here: https://github.com/rhaniehalim/Project-1
